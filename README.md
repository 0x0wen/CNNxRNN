# IF3270 Machine Learning - Tugas Besar 2


## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, **Simple Recurrent Neural Networks (Simple RNN)**, and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks. It aims to provide a deep understanding of neural network architectures by implementing **forward propagation from scratch** and comparing it with models built using **Keras**.

## 📚 Contents

* `src/`: Python source code and notebooks for model training, analysis, and forward propagation implementation.
* `doc/`: Project report in PDF format detailing implementation, experiments, results, and member contributions.

## 🔧 Setup and Execution

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0x0wen/CNNxRNN
   cd CNNxRNN
   cd src
   ```

2. Install required dependencies
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

3. Go into the corresponding directory
    ```bash
    cd {model_dir}
    ```

4. Run the main program
    ```bash
    uv run main.py
    ```
